              <li>Penguin Honyaku only provides translation and editing services from Japanese to English as of now. English to Japanese translation/editing services coming soon!</li>
              <li>We currently cannot handle translations in these areas: Chemistry, Physics, Finance, IT etc.</li> 
              <li>When otherwise specified, all translations/editing will be made in US English (spelling, date formats etc). UK English is also possible.</li>
              <li>We do not recommend literal translations unless the client specifically requests for it as this will often result in unnatural and awkward English.</li>
              <li>We highly recommend cross-check editing over proofreading editing unless you are 99% confident in your English. Cross-check editing services will require the editor to reference to both the original Japanese source document and the English version of it, thus resulting in a better, more accurately edited English document. This may include extensive rewriting, reformatting and the editor might even offer suggestions on how to make it more attractive or readable to the English audience.</li>
              <li>We might not be able to respond to your inquiries immediately due to the time difference between Japan and North America but rest assured that we will get back to you as soon as we can, possibly by the very next working day (even on weekends).</li>
              <li>There are NO hidden charges. Any additional charges (if necessary) will be conveyed to the client beforehand before we proceed on with any translation/editing.</li> 
              <li>NO refunds will be made. Please let us know why you are unsatisfied and we will try to work it out.</li>
              <li>All payments will be made via PayPal as it is the safest way to make overseas payment, and there are no charges or whatsoever that you (as the sender) have to pay. <u><a href="https://www.paypal.com/jp/">Create a PayPayl account here.</a></u></li> 
              <li>For requests that are JPY 100,000 and above, the client will need to make a 30% advance payment first. In addition, the client might be charged 1.5 times the regular rate for tight deadlines (such as one-day turnaround). Please contact us to find out more.</li>
              <li>Deadlines are more important to us than paying our bills!</li>
              <li>All information (job request, personal information, email addresses etc.) are kept strictly confidential and will never be released to any third party (unless the government threatens us).</li>
              <li>Translation/editing services from Chinese to English is also possible so please contact us to find out more.</li>
