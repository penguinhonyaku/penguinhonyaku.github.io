          <h1>Why Us?</h1>
          <div class="content-block">
            <ol>
              <li>Our rates are cheaper than other agencies out there in the market because we cut out the middleman. However, we can assure you that the quality of our work will be the same, or even better!</li>
              <li>You, as a client, are able to communicate with the translator/editor directly since there is no more middleman. This will give you more say and control, and the translator/editor will be able to check with you directly and quickly with regards to any issues/questions. This not only saves time, but the final work delivered will also be naturally better and more detailed.</li>
              <li>Your document will be translated/edited into smooth, fluent and natural English. This is something that you cannot get from translations by non-native speakers!</li>
              <li>Unlike other agencies, we will honestly tell you upfront if we think we cannot handle your request (be it unfamiliar field or tight deadlines).</li>
              <li>Unlike crowd-translations websites (they are cheap because they use inexperienced translators), all our translators/editors are experienced and professionals. To put it simply, you get what you pay for.</li>
              <li>Since we are in the North America, same-day turnaround/delivery is possible due to the time difference (your nighttime is our daytime).</li>
              <li>Our translators/editors have rich and extensive REAL working experience in the following industries/areas: sales & marketing, investigation, cancer research, data analysis, business consulting etc.</li>
              <li>Translation experience: Medical/Pharmaceutical, Life Sciences, General/Business, Scientific Papers/Abstract, Catchphrase, Press Release, News Release, Affidavits, Recommendation Letters, General Letters etc.</li>
              <li>Editing experience: Scientific papers related to Education, Psychology etc., business marketing proposals and powerpoint presentations.</li>
